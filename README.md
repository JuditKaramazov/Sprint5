## Introduction

The following project aims to provide a joke generator, randomly fetching its content by alternating two different APIs (`Dad Jokes` and `Chuck Norris` are involved... get ready for that!).

Also, and considering that one of the main objectives was reporting the users' level of satisfaction, it's also possible to vote for the different jokes and save the results according to the: 
- `Content`
- `Date`
- `Score`

<br>

Since the website's objective focuses on cheering up the employees of a hypothetical company before they start working, we included a weather API displaying the current weather and temperature, as well as an animated background generated with a `Blob Maker application` (https://www.blobmaker.app/).

## Style

In order to customize the assignment, I decided to slightly deviate from the guidelines, including new designs provided by the incredibly talented illustrators of `DrawKit` (https://www.drawkit.com).

- Thanks a lot!
